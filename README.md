# Jekyll-Mono

**Jekyll-Mono** is a simple and elegant GitHub Profile cum Blog theme based on Barry Clark's [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It's a result of my attempt to learn **Jekyll** and create a minimalistic theme to put up my CV alongwith some blog posts.

It is crafted with ðŸ’™ by [Akshay Agarwal](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007).
