## Happy new year here are my resolutions for 2019
-----

Hi there, I write right here what my resolution for 2019 are:

- Learn Vim (I am writing this post on vim and i have learn a few things
  already.)
- Learn React
- Read at least 2 books every month, 1 tech book and another nonfiction or
  fiction book.

On this quote "Stop setting goals. Goals are pure fantasy unless you have a specific plan to achieve them by Stephen Covey."

My plan to achive this goal will be:

VIM: 
- Use vim every day as my main IDLE
- Learn vim from experts on https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/onramp-to-vim
- Read the book Practical Vim by Drew Neil

REACT:
- Watch pluralsight path on react.
- Read the book Fullstack React: The Complete Guide to ReactJS and Friends

READ:
- Peak an audiobook or book on the first day of the month.

Simple as that.
Let's be the year I can achive all and more of these goals.
